# landing-page
This project shows my skills in using flexbox concurrently with css and html. I have been able to learn how max-width can be extremely helpful when you can change the spacing between items with just gap. I also learned to not over-complicate things, and always divide things up into sections, such as left and right. I also learned how to deal with images to make them the right size you need them to be.
